<p>MISS TESMAN.<br>

    Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
    good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
    
         [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.</P>
    
    
   <p> BERTA.<br>
    
    [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
    I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
    Miss. [She places it on the piano.</p>
    
    
   <p> MISS TESMAN.<br>
    
    So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
    wrench to me to part with you.</p>
    
    <p>BERTA.<br>
    
    [On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
    Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p>
    
    
   <p> MISS TESMAN.<br>
    
    We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
    George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
    to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
    
    
    <p> BERTA.<br>
    
    Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
    at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
    learn to take proper care of an invalid.</p>
    
    
    <p> MISS TESMAN.<br>
    
    Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
    most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
    dear Berta.
