    <h3>Name of the play: HEDDA GABLER by <i>Henrik Ibsen</i></h3>

<h6 class="name">MISS TESMAN:</h6>
<p class="speech">Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
    good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p>
    <p class="direction">[She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]</p>
    
    
    <h6 class="name">BERTA:</h6>
    <p class="direction"> [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p>
    <p class="speech">I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
    Miss.</p>
    <p class="direction">[She places it on the piano.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name">MISS TESMAN:</h6>
   <p class="speech"> So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
    wrench to me to part with you.</p>

    <h6 class="name">BERTA:</h6>
    <p class="direction">[On the point of weeping.]</p>
    <p class="speech">And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
    Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p>
    
    <h6 class="name">MISS TESMAN:</h6>
   <p class="speech"> We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
    George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
    to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>

    <h6 class="name">BERTA:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
    at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
    learn to take proper care of an invalid.</p>

    <h6 class="name"> MISS TESMAN:</h6>
    <p class="speech">Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
    most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
    dear Berta.</p>
